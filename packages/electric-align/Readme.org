一気にスペースを挿入して簡単に桁をそろえる

NOTE: This is an experimental work and needs improvement, in the sense
that it's not clear that what the word "alignment" means in the real
examples.

** Usage

Put electric-align.el in a "load-path"ed directory, and require this
script.

: (require 'electric-align)

then call =M-x electric-align-mode= to turn on the mode.

You can also add the function to =prog-mode-hook=, to enable the mode
in all buffers editing programs.

: (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'electric-align-mode)

While =electric-align-mode= is turned on, you can insert a certain
amount of spaces at once by pressing =SPC= multiple times.
